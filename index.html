        Basically we planned to meet each other on a beautiful
        Sunday at Berlin Eastgate, which is located in Marzahn.
        I was there at 1 pm waiting for her. I doubted that I 
        might catch a catfish. I didn't have any data volumm. 
        I tried to find a free wifi, so I could text her to ask 
        her where she is exactly. I sent her a picture of my 
        self sitting and waiting in front of a bank. After a
        while she texted me back that she saw me, but she was 
        too shy to come to me. I have never seen her irl, so I don't 
        actually know if she has come. I couraged her to go to 
        me. After sitting and doubting my life for a while, I saw 
        a girl approaching. I was suprised and also awkward, cause I 
        have never gone out with a girl before. We introduced ourself 
        and just simply travel everywhere in Berlin.

        She loves K-Pop, especially Stray Kids. So I decided 
        to code a website about Stray Kids. <a href="straykids.html">Click here to
        know more about Stray Kids</a>
